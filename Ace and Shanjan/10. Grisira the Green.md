Grisira the Green (Adult) (MM p.94 & 95)

|HP |AC |STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

|Actions|
|---|
|Multiattack. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. |
|Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d1 0 + 6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.|
|Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.|
|Tail. Melee Weapon Attack:+ 11 to hit, reach 15ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.|
|Frightful Presence. Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.|
|Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6). The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.|

|Legendary Resistances|
|---|
|3 |

|Legendary Actions|
|---|
|Detect. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.|
|Tail Attack. The dragon makes a tail attack.|
|Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed. |

|Lair Actions|
|---|
|Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.|
|A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.|
|Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round. |
