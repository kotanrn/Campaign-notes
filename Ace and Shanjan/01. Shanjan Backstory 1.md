### Inciting Action / Hook: 
After Shanjan a letter from his sister asking for help he left. Shanjan later contacted Ace asking for his help figuring out why people have gone missing. Shanjan thought it was due to a nearby cave, but that turned out not to be it. They woke up after investigating the cave to an assassin in their room. 


### Storyline: 
Ace and Shanjan leave the loggers' camp headed northeast to the city of Bridcaster where Shanjan's sister (Aveis) lives. Significant silver motiffe around sister's farmhouse

Over dinner, they discuss an alarming amount of Bridcaster hunters have gone missing in the nearby forest. After dinner conversations include the existance of a place called the Feywild.



_The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land of soft lights and wonder, a place of music and death. It is a realm of everlasting twilight, with glittering faerie lights bobbing in the gentle breeze and fat fireflies buzzing through groves and fields. The sky is alight with the faded colors of an ever-setting sun, which never truly sets (or rises for that matter); it remains stationary, dusky and low in the sky._

_The landscape of the Feywild mirrors the natural world but turns its features into spectacular forms. Where a volcano stands on the Material Plane, a mountain topped with skyscraper-sized crystals that glow with internal fire towers in the Feywild. A wide and muddy river on the Material Plane might be echoed as a clear and winding brook of great beauty. A marsh could be reflected as a vast black bog of sinister character. And moving to the Feywild from old ruins on the Material Plane might put a traveler at the door of an arch fey's castle._

_Fey bargains are much more often verbal than written down, which gives the fey more room to maneuver with misleading language, riddles, and the like, rather than the fine print that devils favor._



Before leaving the next morning Gaxan gives 2x Potion of Healing (2d4 + 2 healing each; DMG p. 188); all agree to meet at The Smelly Bison Inn. Aveis and Gaxan will gather villagers at the inn.

Ace & Shanjan explore the forest, multiple combat encounters. They choose a cardinal direction and explore it. (One combat per direction except the west with three.)

Someone answers talking about its minions killing villagers.

"What minions?"

"The Awakened Shrubs, Awakened Trees, Black Bears, and the Guard Drake."

"My Guard Drake would never do such a thing without my direct orders. And I didn't order it."
