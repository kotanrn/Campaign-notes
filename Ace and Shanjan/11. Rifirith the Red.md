|Actions||
|---|---|
|Multiattack.|The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.|
|Bite.|Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.|
|Claw.|Melee Weapon Attack:+ 14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.|
|Tail.|Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.|
|Frightful Presence.|Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.|
|Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).|The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.|

|Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed |

|Lair Actions|
|---|
|Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.|
|A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.|
|Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.|
